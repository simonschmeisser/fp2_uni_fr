\section{Procedure and Analysis}

\subsection{Initiation and characteristics of the laser diode}

After switching on the laser diode and the thermoelectric cooler, we controlled the progression and the coherence of the laser beam and verified the correct position of the lenses, so that the beam focused on the detector of the photodiode. We did this by using an infrared display unit and a white piece of paper in order to be able to see the actual progression of the beam.\\

We then turned on the photodiode and the preamplifier, which we set to DC and the gain to 40 dB. We installed the etalon into the optical path and set it perpendicular to the beam. The laser was modulated by a sawtooth voltage in order to be able to see a few wavelength-peaks of the etalon.\\

In the first part of this measurement, the current of the diode was held at a constant value of $I = (35.1\pm 0.3)\ mA$ while the temperature was varied from $34.0^\circ C$ to $36.5^\circ C$. We measured the scrolling of the peaks in dependence of the temperature.
In the second part of the measurement, we held the temperature constant at a value of $T=(34.7 \pm 0.2)\ ^\circ C$ and changed the current from 20.4 to 36.7 mA.
Our measurements were okay, but left room for improvement, which we did in the second week, with the following adjustments:\\

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}[H]{l l c}
Constant Temperature & \\
Temperature & $T=34.7 ^\circ C$\\
Current & $I = 54.0 \dots 69.0\ mA$\\
 & \\
Constant Current & \\
Laser Current & $I = 64.4 mA$\\
Temperature & $T=32.3 \dots 33.65\ ^\circ C$\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

For both measurements, we followed one peak and measured its position in dependence of the current or the temperature of the laser diode. We used the distance of the different peaks to calculate the calibration factor $f$ between the relative position $\Delta t$ and the relative frequency $\nu$ of the peak. It is given by

$$ f = \frac{FSR}{\Delta t} \ \ \ \ \ \text{with the error}\ \ \ \ \ \frac{s_f}{f} \approx \frac{s_{FSR}}{FSR} = 3.00 \cdot 10^{-3} $$

where FSR is the free spectral range of the etalon, whose numerical value is $FSR = (9924 \pm 30)\ MHz$. The error $s_t$ is negligible. The frequency is the given by:

$$\nu = f\cdot t \ \ \ \ \ \text{with the error}\ \ \ \ \ \frac{s_\nu}{\nu} \approx \frac{s_f}{f} = 3.00 \cdot 10^{-3} $$

\subsubsection{Constant Temperature}

By measuring the distance between two peaks we were able to calculate the calibration factor between time and frequency.

$$f = (70.886 \pm  0.214) \frac{MHz}{\mu s} $$

We then were able to plot the relative frequency in dependence of the variation of the laser current and by linear regression find out their relation.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{BilderAusw/T_fest.pdf}
\caption{Variation of the laser current with constant temperature}
\end{figure}

As one can see, the slope is negative, which means that by increasing the current, the light emitted by the laser has a lower frequency. We find that the slope is

$$ a = (-3.858 \pm 0.056)\ \frac{GHz}{mA}$$

which is the conversion factor between the frequency $\nu$ of the laser light and the current $I$ of the diode.

\subsubsection{Constant Current}

The calibration gave us the same conversion factor as before, i.e.

$$f = (70.886 \pm  0.214) \frac{MHz}{\mu s} $$

and we plotted the relative frequency in dependence of the temperature of the laser.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{BilderAusw/I_fest.pdf}
\caption{Variation of the laser temperature with constant current}
\end{figure}

Here, one is also able to see, that with increasing temperature, the frequency decreases. Also, we can see a mode jump near 32.5$^\circ C$. Both parts were fitted by a straight line, and the slopes are as follows:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}[H]{l l}
First Slope & $a_1 = (-31.81 \pm 2.05) \frac{GHz}{^\circ C}$\\
Second Slope & $a_2 = (-31.70 \pm 1.12) \frac{GHz}{^\circ C}$\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

For the rest of the measurements, we always used temperatures superior to 32,5 $^\circ C$, so the second slope is the one relevant as a conversion factor between temperature and frequency.

\subsubsection{Results}

\begin{tabular}[H]{l c}
Conversion Factors: & \\
Frequency-Current & $\Delta\nu = \Delta I \cdot (-3.858 \pm 0.056)\ {Ghz}/{mA}$\\
Frequency-Temperature & $\Delta\nu = \Delta T \cdot (-31.70 \pm 1.12)\ {Ghz}/{^\circ C}$\\
\end{tabular}


\subsection{Hyperfine Structure}

We installed the Rubidium cell into the optical path and removed the etalon. The laser diode was modulated by a triangular voltage with a peak-to-peak difference of $\sim 200\ mV$, and the temperature was set to $T = (34.6 \pm 0.2)^\circ C$, as described in the instructions. The preamplifier was set to AC from now on. However, with these adjustments we weren't able to find the hyperfine structure of the Rubidium atoms. Furthermore, the current of the laser diode wasn't able to surpass 35 mA and the preamplifier of the photodiode  was overcharged. We then tried different adjustments and installed a neutral filter (\emph{D 4,3}) into the optical path. The new adjustment was:\\

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}[H]{l c}
Temperature & $T=34.4 ^\circ C$\\
Peak-to-Peak Voltage & $U_{pp} = 134\ mV$\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

We were then able to see the hyperfine structure at a current of $I = (62.9 \pm 0.3)\ mA$. With the same adjustments, we did another calibration. For this, however, we had to remove the filter, because the peaks weren't visible else. This measurement was also redone in the second week with the following adjustments:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}[H]{l c}
Temperature & $T=34.5 ^\circ C$\\
Peak-to-Peak Voltage & $U_{pp} = 4\ V$\\
Laser Current & $I = 63.9 mA$\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering \includegraphics[width=0.96\textwidth]{BilderAusw/HFS.pdf}
\caption{Hyperfine spectrum of Rubidium}
\end{figure}

With the etalon, we were able to calibrate our measurements, i.e. to determine the time-frequency conversion factor $f$:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}[H]{l l}
Left side (descending laser current) & $f = (36.99 \pm 0.11) \frac{MHz}{\mu s}$\\
Right side (ascending laser current) &  $ f = (34.46 \pm 0.10) \frac{MHz}{\mu s}$\\ 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

With this calibration and the position of the maxima, we can calculate their relative frequency. We assume the $^{85}Rb$ 3-2 and 3-3 peak to be known, so that we can determine the other peaks from the relative frequency in dependence of this one. The results are summarized in the following table:

\subsubsection{Determination of the interval constant}

\subsection{Double Resonance}

For this part, we inserted the quarter-wave plate. We controlled its correct adjustment using a linear polarizer. Then, the radio frequency inductor coil (RF), situated on the Rubidium cell, was switched on. The current was set to about 10 V and the frequency was $\nu_{RF} = (499.3 \pm 0.3) kHz$, which we measured with a frequency counter. We then tried to find the correct adjustments for the laser diode. We did this by modulating the inductor coil 2 with a sawtooth function with a large amplitude and then varying the laser current until absorptions were visible. Having found the correct laser current, we changed the sawtooth function to a sine modulation in order to start the measurements.

With the sawtooth, we found the following laser currents to show absorption lines in the spectrum:

$$ I_1 = (65.4 \pm 0.2)\ mA $$
$$ I_2 = (64.9 \pm 0.2 )\ mA $$

The temperature of the laser diode was $T=(34.0 \pm 0.2)^\circ C$
 
\begin{figure}[H] 
\begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth} 
\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{BilderAusw/DR_1.pdf}
\caption{Absorption at $I = 64.9\ mA$}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth} 
\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{BilderAusw/DR_2.pdf}
\caption{Absorption at $I = 65.4\ mA$}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

The inductor coil 2 was then modulated with a sine function of 50 Hz and the laser was set to one of the two resonance frequencies. The current through the inductor coil 1 was then changed until the visible absorption peaks were equidistant and then the current of the inductor coil 4 was changed in order to make the peaks as high as possible. After the adjustment of the coil 4, we readjusted the coil 1, to assure equidistance of the peaks. Then the polarity of inductor coil 1 was reversed and the equidistance was readjusted. We got the following values:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}[H]{c | c c c}
Resonance Current & $I(coil1)/mA$ & $I(coil1)_{rev.pol.}$ & $I(coil4)/mA$ \\ \hline
$I_1 = (65.4 \pm 0.2)\ mA$ & $102 \pm 1$ & $79 \pm 1$ & $80 \pm 5$ \\
$I_2 = (64.9 \pm 0.2 )\ mA$ & $144 \pm 1$ & $123\pm1$ & $84\pm5$ \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

These values allow us to determine the earth's magnetic field. The magnetic field of the induction coil 4 cancels the vertical magnetic field of the earth, which means, that it should have the same value. The difference between the two magnetic fields of both polarities should be twice the earth's horizontal magnetic field.\\

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{BilderAusw/DRequi.pdf}
\caption{Equidistant Absorption Peaks}
\end{figure}


To calculate the magnetic field from the current through the coils, we use the measured values given in the experiment's description:

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{BilderAusw/Spulenumr.png}
\end{figure}

So, $B=a\cdot I$ whereas $a$ is the conversion factor. Since for coil 1: \ $I=\frac{1}{2}|I_{pol1}-I_{pol2}|$, the error is $$s_I^{coil1} = \sqrt{s_{I_{pol1}}^2 + s_{I_{pol2}}^2} = 1.41$$
The error for B is then:

$$s_B = B\cdot\sqrt{\left(\frac{s_a}{a}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{s_I}{I}\right)^2}$$

We calculate the following values:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}[H]{c | c c}
 & Horizontal magnetic field & Vertical magnetic field \\ \hline
Current $I_1$ & $B_{hor}^{(1)} = (9.19 \pm 1.1)\ \mu T$ & $B_{vert}^{(1)} = (38.08 \pm 2.38)\ \mu T$\\
Current $I_2$& $B_{hor}^{(2)} = (8.39 \pm 1.1)\ \mu T$ & $B_{vert}^{(2)} = (39.98 \pm 2.38)\ \mu T$\\
Theoretical Values & $B_{hor} = 20.9 \mu T$ & $B_{vert} = 42.9 \mu T$\\
Standard Deviations & 11, 12 & 3, 2\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

As one can see, the values for the horizontal field clearly differ from the theoretical values ($\sim$ factor 2). Since the theoretical horizontal value is meant to be the magnetic field in north-south direction, it occurred to us that maybe the optical bench didn't point in that specific direction. We used a compass to realign the table, so that the photo diode pointed towards north and the laser diode was south from it. The table now had an angle of about 30$^\circ$ towards its initial position. By using the compass, we detected that the optical bench itself was magnetized, which we assumed to be a potential disturbance source.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{BilderAusw/Nordsued.png}
\caption{North-South orientation of the optical bench}
\end{figure}

With this new orientation, we redid all the measurements from scratch. The results are summarized in the following tables. (Laser temperature : $T=(34.1 \pm 0.2)^\circ C$)

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}[H]{c | c c c c c}
 & $I(pol1)_{coil1}/mA$ & $I(pol2)_{coil1}/mA$ & $I_{colt4}/mA$ & $B_{hor}/\mu T$ & $B_{vert}/\mu T$\\ \hline
$I_{Laser} = (65.3 \pm 0.2)$ & $105 \pm 1$ & $74 \pm 1$ & $ 81\pm 5$ & $12.38 \pm 1.13$ & $38.56 \pm 2.38$\\
$I_{Laser} = (64.9 \pm 0.2)$ & $151 \pm 1$ & $120 \pm 1$ & $ 83\pm 5$ & $12.38 \pm 1.13$ & $39.51 \pm 2.38$\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The theoretical value for the horizontal field lies within the 8th standard deviation of both our calculated values and the theoretical value of the vertical field lies within the 2nd. The value for the horizontal field greatly improved, the one for the vertical field slightly worsened. We can assume, as discussed before, that the fact that our values lie underneath the theoretical value, is due to the magnetization of the optical bench. Also, the abrasion of the induction colts could be an error source.

\subsubsection{The nuclear spin}

We determine the nuclear spin of the Rubidium isotopes with the formula:

$$ I = \frac{\mu_BB}{h\nu_{RF}}-\frac{1}{2} $$

The vertical magnetic field was compensated by the induction colt 4. $B$ is the magnetic field of colt 1 when the peaks are equidistant subtracted by (resp. added to) the earth's horizontal magnetic field. $\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton.

The error of the nuclear spin is determined by:

$$ s_I = I\cdot\sqrt{\left(\frac{s_B}{B}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{s_{\nu_{RF}}}{\nu_{RF}}\right)^2} $$

We have

$$I_1 = (84.5 \pm 1.5) mA \Rightarrow B_1 = (67.52 \pm 1.20)\mu T$$
$$I_2 = (130.5 \pm 1.5) mA \Rightarrow B_2 = (104.27 \pm 1.21)\mu T$$

The nuclear spins are:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}[H]{| l c c c c |}\hline
Isotope & Value & Theoretical Value & Error & Standard Deviations \\ \hline
(1)\ \ $^{87}Rb$ & $1.39 \pm 0.02$ & 1.5 & 7.3\% & 6 \\
(2)\ \ $^{85}Rb$ & $2.42 \pm 0.01$ & 2.5 & 3.2\% & 8\\  \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The measured values lie close to the theoretical ones. The error on the value is very small, so that a systematical error seems to cause most of the deviation. Again, the disturbing fields, such as the magnetization of the optical bench and other magnetic fields seem to have a non-negligible effect on the experiment and lead to this error.

\clearpage
\subsection{Spin Precession}

Firstly, we compensated the horizontal field with the induction coil 1, i.e. we set it to 15.5 mA (we adjusted it in a way that the ampere meter flickered between 15 and 16 mA since it doesn't have more digits). The coil 4 and the RF were turned off.

We modulated the current of the induction coil 5 with a rectangular function and adjusted the offset, so that the minima of the rectangular function lie on 0. The result is that periodically the magnetic field is turned on and off, so that the atoms are aligned by the magnetic field and then suddenly the field ceases. The result is, that the atoms' angular momentum precesses around the earth's vertical magnetic field the moment the field is turned off.
