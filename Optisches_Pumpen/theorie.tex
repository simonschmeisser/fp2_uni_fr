\subsection{Atomar spectra, fine structure and hyperfine structure}

The nucleus of an atom induces an electric field, which binds electrons in rotations around it. Those circular paths are quantized according to the boundary conditions the electron's wavefunction underlies in the Coulomb field. The electron's state is classically described by its principal quantum number $n$ and it's angular momentum $l$. If one considers the intrinsic angular momentum of the electron, the so called spin $s$, one receives
